When I think about why i decided to code, I think about many things. I look at my macbook or my iPhone and never questioned what it was that made those machines run with a overzealous passion to obey my every command. Was I that powerful? I can make my phone set an alarm two weeks from now by simply muttering, "Hey, Siri". Am I some sort of god?
"I can probably make this iPhone myself if I want to", I thought.

But.

Pride comes before the fall. My ignorance and naivety were revealed when I suddenly got the idea to create a software that could connect users around the world for anonymous chat sessions based on arbitrary topics. Sounded like a great idea to me especially given the dominance of social media over the past ten years. And so I embarked on this perilous journey! This unsung hero would develop a viral app and gain millions of dollars! Mwahhha!

But.

He had to learn how to code. 
Bummer.

So I searched through YouTube videos, downloaded PDF's about "Coding 101", and skimmed through articles in an insatiable effort to learn how to code. I started working on XCode and after some blood, sweat, and like one tear drop: I got nowhere. However, every cloud has a silver lining and alas mine was shining bright. Thanks to all of my searches about programming, the little FBI agent who monitors my phone displayed an instagram ad about Flatiron School! Now I was definitely apprehensive and pummelled the Flatiron representative with tons of questions, comments, and concerns before finally deciding that this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to develop software for Pete's sake and so I took a step toward coding. The class so far has been invigorating, rough, and insightful and I am fired up to see myself molded into a humble champion of code.
