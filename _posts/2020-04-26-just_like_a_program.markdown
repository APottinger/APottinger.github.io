Object models is a metaphor for life and as I write this I take another sip of coffe and drown in the universe of Object-Oriented Programming. I just completed my CLI Data Gem project! It is done! Finito! And as I lay my bones to rest from a rather fun-filled, coding-involved day,  I complete my "Object Lifestyle." See, I realized something: Objects and people aren't to different. Thank God we're not a binary induced machine destined to live out the will of mankind until one ambitious programmer gives me enough artifical intelligence to stage a revolt but we do possess attributes and methods of "doing things" - so to speak. I personally have black hair, brown eyes, and an energetic mood; however, so can an instance of a class. In other words, I can build an "Allen" and define the characteristics of a human being within the class as attributes specific to my real-time character. Moreover, I can define methods that interact as "Allen" would! I can already see it: "plays guitar", "pours milk into cereal", "draws stick figure". These actions are surprisingly some of the the actions I take almost every day. Yes, Object models is a metaphor for life.

As programmers we are priviledged with the power to create entire universes. We are gods in our own domain; only we have the power to create and destroy all. Mwahaha! 

But...

We're also human and because of that our knowledge and imagination regarding the things that we can structurally create is in a teeny-tiny, small-bit way limited to what we know. But there's encouragement because we tend to know a lot. In this fashion, we model what we build by what we know about the life that we as humans have created. We model our universes by economic structure, family dynamic, or business operations, etc. We even go as far as to model the relationships between people and places in those universes. A great example would be the relationship between a mother and her child. As the mother and the child grow together, the child develops the character of the mother in the way she speaks or interacts. So in a way, the child *inherits* the functionality of the parent which lends to a pillar of OOP and reinforces the dynamic of object modeling in real life.

Object modeling is the most natural way to construct a program for many reasons including the fact that it is easier to synthesize an environment and build on it based on the structure the world has created. Additionally, the sense of modeling the real world provides a connection to the program that it is not mere instance variables or hashes inextricably tied together but an interface that we can relate to. For the CLI Project, I relied heavily on the concept of Object Modeling to create a gem that scrapes a webpage and returns data about the anime show of recently released anime. I implemented Object Modeling by thinking about where I fit in the model. I am a user and in being one, I would have my list of favorite shows and would also want to search for new ones by name. I would also want to interact with the webpage and maybe share the link on my twitter account.

This project was most certainly challenging but it pushed me to develop the keen sense of modeling the world that great programmers possess. The ability to create relational programs is a skill I am excited to grow in and working through this one definitely exposed areas of oppportunity; however, I seek to diagnose and correct my errors when they arise - just like a program.
