<p>Me, myself, and I am excited and grateful that your curiosity led you to my blog page. Allow me to exercise my hospitality: *clears throat* WELCOME! I am an FIU undergrad student born and raised in Miami, Florida who loves to play sports, guitar & piano, and write poetry in spare time!  My blog post is centered around freedom of expression and passion for programming with Ruby while still creating content through which others can learn from - the best part! I am totally excited for the opportunity to share my thoughts candidly and potentially help others develop a unique zeal for software development through witnessing my own! #=>Enjoy </p>
